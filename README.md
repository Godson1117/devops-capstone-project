## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **Customer Accounts Microservice**. This project is the core component of the DevOps Capstone, designed to demonstrate the application of Agile methodologies, cloud-native development, and CI/CD automation.

The goal is to build a robust, RESTful microservice while strictly adhering to DevOps best practices, starting from the initial Agile planning phase ("Sprint 0") through to deployment.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Sprint 0 & Agile Planning

Currently, the project is in the **Planning / Sprint 0** phase. The primary objective is to simulate a real-world Agile development environment.

### Key Activities
- [x] **Repository Setup:** Initialization of the GitHub repository.
- [ ] **Kanban Board:** Setting up the project board to manage the Agile workflow.
- [ ] **User Story Templates:** Creating standardized templates for consistent requirement gathering.
- [ ] **Backlog Construction:** Populating the product backlog with stories required to build the Customer Accounts service.
- [ ] **Backlog Refinement:** Sorting, prioritizing, and labeling stories (High/Medium/Low priority).
- [ ] **Sprint Planning:** Estimating story points, assigning tasks, and creating the backlog for Sprint 1.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

* **Version Control:** GitHub
* **Project Management:** GitHub Projects (Kanban) / ZenHub
* **Architecture:** RESTful Microservices
* **Containerization:** Docker (Planned)
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes / OpenShift (Planned)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / Jenkins (Planned)

## 📋 User Stories & Backlog

The development of this microservice is driven by user stories managed via the Project Board. The backlog process involves:

1.  **Drafting:** Identifying requirements for the Customer Account features (CRUD operations).
2.  **Sorting:** Categorizing stories into appropriate pipelines.
3.  **Refining:** Adding acceptance criteria and technical details.
4.  **Estimating:** Assigning story points based on complexity.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

Following the completion of the planning phase, the project will move into development sprints covering:
1.  **Environment Setup:** Configuring the development environment and CI/CD pipeline.
2.  **Development:** Coding the REST endpoints for the Customer Accounts service.
3.  **Testing:** Implementing Test Driven Development (TDD).
4.  **Deployment:** Deploying the containerized service to the cloud.
